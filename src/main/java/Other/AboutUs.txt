	Welcome to our long-standing establishment which was founded sometime in the early 90’s,
a place where trends checked in but never checked out. Our founder was a visionary who believed that
the 90’s were the pinnacle of human achievement and was so committed to his nostalgia that he decided
to take the ultimate step: locking himself away in one of the hotel rooms to live forever in the past.

	While any attempt to contact the founder was futile, he left behind a legacy of average
nostalgia. Rooms boasting beige wallpaper, CRT televisions with built-in VHS players, and a mini-bar
featuring snacks that expired around the same time the hotel was founded. And don’t worry about the
ghosts; they’re just former guests who couldn’t bear to leave. Join us at “The Average Hotel”, where we
embrace mediocrity - because being average is our specialty, and we excel at being just okay in every
possible way.
